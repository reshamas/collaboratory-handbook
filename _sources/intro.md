# Collaboratory Handbook

This handbook provides content to help access and navigate the Collaboratory, a WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence [initiative](https://www.who.int/initiatives/collaboratory) that **provides a digital space** where the pandemic and epidemic intelligence (PEI) community convenes to address critical challenges that affect the way data is accessed, analyzed, visualized, and communicated for better pandemic and epidemic policy and response decision making.

You can find the Collaboratory at:  [collab-forum.who.int](https://collab-forum.who.int/)

Some of our current communities of practice include: [Epiparameters](https://who-collaboratory.github.io/collaboratory-epiparameter-community/#/), Influenza, Mpox, [PEI Innovation Forum](https://pandemichub.who.int/news-room/innovation-forum), Dengue, and more.
