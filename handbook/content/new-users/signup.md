### Set Up MFA
- **Install an Authenticator App**: Ensure you have either Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator (your choice) installed on your mobile device.
- **Scan QR Code**: On the Collaboratory website, use your chosen Authenticator app to scan the QR code displayed on the screen. This links your app to your Collaboratory account.
- **Enter Verification Code**: Type in the 6-digit code generated by your Authenticator app into the Collaboratory verification fields. (Please note that this code expires in less than 10 seconds).
